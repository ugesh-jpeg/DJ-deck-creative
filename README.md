🎧 DJ Application – Built with JUCE
This project is a fully-featured DJ application developed using the JUCE framework, combining core audio mixing functionalities with a polished, interactive user interface.

🔑 Features
Multi-track playback: Load and mix two audio tracks simultaneously.

Independent deck controls: Adjust volume, speed, and apply looping per track.

Enhanced UI: Gradient-themed decks with Pause, Restart, Loop, Rewind, and Fast Forward buttons.

Waveform visualization: Dynamic, colored waveforms with real-time playback indicators.

Playlist manager: Table-based track list with Import and Load options, including deck selection.

Dynamic info display: Real-time updates for "Now Playing" and track timing.

🛠️ Technical Highlights
Built with OOP principles and event-driven programming for modularity and responsiveness.

Uses JUCE components like AudioTransportSource, ResamplingAudioSource, and MixerAudioSource.

Incorporates lambda functions for event handling and custom timer-based logic for looping and display updates.

🔍 Inspiration
Key features like looping and dynamic track feedback were inspired by professional DJ tools like VirtualDJ.

📌 Outcome
The final app demonstrates real-time audio control, a refined UI, and extensible code architecture—making it suitable for both educational and live DJ performance use.
